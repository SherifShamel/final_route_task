# route_task

A Final Flutter Task.

## Getting Started
This screen is a screen made for an e-commerce app.

it has several layers and functions:

1- Data Layer: this is the layer where we call the api to get data from it.
2- Domain Layer: and this is the layer when we call the data from the api to use it in the app.
3- Presentation Layer: and finally the last layer where we get the data, and present it to the UI and
the user actually sees something.

What I did in this screen is: I got the api from data layer and domain layer, and presented it in the presentation
layer so the user can see it, that means if the api or data is corrupted, the UI will not be affected at all.
